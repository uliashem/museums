    description: "The domed glass-and-steel ceiling at the British Museum – the world’s first national museum opened to the public – lets light into the atrium-like Great Court below, bouncing off the blinding-white, sweeping staircases and marble walls. It’s one of the capital’s prettiest spaces, but beyond the impressive lobby, it has sprawling galleries dedicated to the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans. Artefacts including the Rosetta Stone, Pantheon Marbles (once a part of the original structure in Athens) and more than 120 mummies draw millions of visitors every year. This is the city’s most-visited attraction, and it’s easy to see why.",

    description: "The ornate façade of the Natural History Museum is a love letter to Victorian architecture: a vast gothic building that looks more like a cathedral than a museum. Inside the lofty Hintze Hall (revamped in 2017 to strip it back to its 19th-century splendour), Hope, a ginormous blue-whale skeleton, hangs above the information desk, which doubles up as a bar when the museum throws late-night sessions. See dinosaur fossils, the first edition of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species and casts from Pompeii among the museum’s 80 million specimens.",

    description: "Another free museum in South Kensington, dedicated to the miracle of technological progress… and all the neat things we’ve discovered along the way. Some of the ‘classic’ galleries at The Science Museum focusing on the birth of steam power are a little fusty, but the bit about space travel is neat, and there are tons of neat interactive exhibitions to play with. The Wonderlab area (which isn’t free alas) is full of hands-on experiments that kids will go absolutely bananas for. ",

    description: "London’s largest art museum – the eighth-biggest art museum in the world – has more than 100 galleries displaying everything from photography to jewellery. It has put on some of the city’s most talked-about exhibitions in recent years: the curators have become known for their hot-ticket fashion displays of designers, including Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen. Make sure to visit the permanent Rapid Response Collection, which has contemporary pieces that react to significant moments in recent history, such as the 'pussyhats' worn at protests against the election of Donald Trump to a 3D-printed Extinction Rebellion coin.",

It’s full of often challenging exhibitions, from displays on World War I to the Holocaust.",
